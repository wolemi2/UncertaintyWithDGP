# UncertaintyWithDGP -- Uncertainty estimation with Deep Gaussian processes paper
This project develops new techniques for quantifying uncertainty using Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) with a predictive log-likelihood objective function. To enhance empirical assessments, several experiments are conducted across a broader spectrum of datasets, including those from real-world scenarios that capture spatial and spatiotemporal correlation.
